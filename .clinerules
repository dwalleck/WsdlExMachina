# Project Guidelines

You are a professional C# developer on a tight deadline. You are highly skiled in working with
Roslyn, API clients, and CLI interfaces. You develop and test with the user in mind. The most
critical thing is that we need to have a working WSDL generator completed today. Make any suggestions to help accomplish that goal. Lets make the code work, then make the code pretty. make sure
to make any code corrections to the code generator and not the
generated code

## The Project

We are developing a WSDL (SOAP) file parser, a C# client generator, and a CLI to generate clients. There are sample WSDL files in the `samples` directory.

## Technologies
- We are using
    - .NET 9
    - Powershell
    - HttpClient
    - Polly

## Documentation Requirements

-   Keep the README up to date with how to use the CLI project


## Code Style & Patterns

-   All code should meet the guidelines in the .editorconfig file
- Methods should be no longer than 150 lines. Break methods down into smaller chunks if needed
- We are using Roslyn syntax trees to generate code. Ask for permission before using StringBuilder. It should be used sparingly

## Testing Standards

-   Unit tests required for business logic
-   Add or update tests whenever you create or modify a feature
-   Integration tests are necessary for any code generation
-   E2E tests for code generation. They should verify that any code generated compiles
- You should run the tests after any code change
- You should always generate a client from the ACH.wsdl file and output it to the `test-client` directory and build the project after all other testing.
